 Code Refactor

Description

The challenge given was to view the code given, view the html elements and make sure that they are written in a logical and proper format. To then test each of the URLs to insure that they all work properly. Each image was given an alt attribute and finally the website was given the title "Website Optimization" because that was the whole basis of the content.
